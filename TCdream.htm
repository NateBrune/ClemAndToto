Today I dreamed I had a free period in school so I decided to go to The
Secret Tunnel. The Secret Tunnel was a tunnel I had in the same dream a
while ago. So to get there I first went into the vent in the wall to get
to a secret bathroom that was like a maze and then I went down a nice ballroom
type staircase and there were three ways to go. On the left there was a
long passage way I really should have explored, and on the right there
was an elevator I really should have gone up to see what there was, but
I went down the middle way.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT COLOR="#990000"><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></FONT></B>

It was short and had a door at the end. I went through the door and there
were five more, two on each side and one at the end. They were all labled
with a thing like "Stand" or "Sit" or "Walk" or "Slide," but I went through
the one that said "Crawl," since you need to crawl through the tunnel.
It had a sliding door and I went in the room. It was about the size of
an elevator and had nothing in it exept a leather flap on the floor. I
lifted the flap and went down into a huge auditorium with red velvet seats.
I could Just slide down them, they were so soft, so I did a bellyflop onto
them and glided down until I flew up and bounced really high off one seat
and jumped effortlessly off the next and flew up to a big lip-shaped hole
near the top of the wall and went in.</FONT></FONT></B>

That was the real tunnel. It was brightly lit and all different colors.
It had soft cushiony sides and floor and ceiling, and was so small you
had to crawl on your belly. It had dips and hills and coushiony blocks
and donuts you could bounce over, because you didn't really crawl through
it, you bounced along.The tunnel came out into the local dairy and the
dream ended.</FONT></FONT></B>

Today I dreamed I was some kind of troll or something. I was going to get
married to some other troll, and he wanted me to get us a marraige dinner.
He wanted to eat one of my cockatiels. I went over to the cage and took
out bweep (there was three other cockatiels instead of one other). I decided
to get her to catch a mole for us to eat instead like the last time we
got married (a flashback of the last time she caught a mole goes through
my head). She walks around on the floor, but doesn't find a mole. Then
the dream ended.</FONT></H3>

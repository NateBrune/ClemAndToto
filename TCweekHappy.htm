Todays topic - My science teacher Mr. Kobler. He can brighten up any day
for me. He is sort of old with gray and white hair. I'll probably be writing
about him again, he's weird. He talks in third person. Today we had tacos
in school for lunch, and I have science right after lunch.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#2B991E"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mr Kobler caught a kid eating chips in class and says "It's all right,
Mr. Kobler didn't finish his chips either." Then he held up his chips which
were the same kind as the kid's, and says "But Mr. Kobler finished his
tacos. Mr. Kobler loves tacos." Then he said in a low rumbly voice "Mmmmm.
Tacos." while rubbing his belly.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#2B991E"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It's funnier if you see it. I didn't finish my tacos. Some stupid boy in
my seat stuck his elbow in my tacos and ruined them and his shirt. Me and
my friend moved to another table. At the very end on the other side of
the table was three goofy boys who pushed the table out and since the chairs
aren't connected to the table we slid against the stuff next to us, which
ruined my tacos even more.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#2B991E"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then this boy in my italian class who likes me sits down right next to
me and says "Yo, What's my name?" I say "Shavez"
Because that's what he insists I call him. Then all these dumb boys are
crouding around the table and staring at me and the best thing to do in
that situation is offer them a cheese-it so I did and "Shavez" moves over
and this really ugly kid I hate comes to sits next to me.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#2B991E"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He's the one I originally called a "Pop Tart." He tried to sit next to
me but "Shavez" comes to my rescue and pulls the seat out from under him
so he falls down. I offered him a cheeze-it. Things were getting pretty
crazy with cheeze-it's flying everywhere and ugly boys all over the table
when the aid comes and chases them all away.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#000099"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can't beat
your brother in an argument? You need practice. If you think he's too good
to beat, try avoiding him or side with him. If he says you're stupid you
can say yes, and proud of it. He will probably say ha ha, you're stupid.
You can say yes, I am. He can't feel like he won the argument if you act
like it isn't an argument, beleive me, I have a brother too. Of course,
now I always win the arguments, but when I was little that was what I did.
If you can't stand to actually say you are stupid, just avoid him as much
as possible.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#CC0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp; The only thing that is keeping
you from being happy is yourself. You need to smile and say "I am happy!!!!"
Eating a cream filled cupcake also helps. People ask why I'm always so
happy and I tell them I'ts only because I choose to be happy. By the way,
How can you not be happy when you call yourself Mr. Noodle?</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
